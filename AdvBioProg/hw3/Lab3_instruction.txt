Implement this method that returns a random sequence from an arbitrary alphabet

public static String 
generateRandomSequence(char[] alphabet, float[] weights, int length) 
	throws Exception
{
…
}

You should be able to run the main method from here:

https://github.com/afodor/metagenomicsTools/blob/master/src/classExamples/Assignment3_Stub.java

Your method should:
	check to see that alphabet and weights have the same length
	check to see that length >= 0
	check to see that the sum of weights is within round-off error of 1
	Return a random string of characters sampled with replacement from alphabet[] 
		with relative frequencies set by weights[]
If your code fails any of the pre-conditions raise an error with throw new Exception(“error message”);
